# Java-Makefile-with-hello-world

The reason I want to show this project is that I know lots of people have not seen the style of using makefile along with their program. Therefore, I think this project will be useful for people who start learning using makefile.

This project will demonstrate how to use the makefile in unix timeshare to execute .java file

Steps to do run the file in unix:
1. log in the unix timeshare

2. use "cd" commend to access the folder wherever you store the files

3. (optional) you can use "ls" or "vim" to check whether you are in the correct folder or using the correct file (use Control-Z to exit vim editing)

4. type "make" to let Makefile execute the file for me (Remember when you type make in unix, it will look for the Makefile to execute the program)

5. That's it!
